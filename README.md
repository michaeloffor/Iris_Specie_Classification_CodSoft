<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on the famous Iris dataset. The goal was to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the species of an iris flower based on the features provided in the dataset.</p>

<h2Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset used for this project is the classic Iris dataset, which includes the following features:</p>

<li>SepalLengthCm: The length of the sepal in centimeters.</li>
<li>SepalWidthCm: The width of the sepal in centimeters.</li>
<li>PetalLengthCm: The length of the petal in centimeters.</li>
<li>PetalWidthCm: The width of the petal in centimeters.</li>
<li>Species: The target variable, representing the iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).</li>
<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<li>Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values (if any), normalizing/standardizing features, and preparing the data for model training.</li>
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand the distribution of the features and their relationships with the target variable.</li>
<li>Model Training: Training K Neighbor Classifier machine learning model to classify iris species.</li>
<li>Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.</li>
<li>Prediction: Using the model to predict the species of iris flowers.</li>
